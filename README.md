Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
The process of designing, developing and maintaining software applications using engineering priciples, methods and tools. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages such as Fortran and C which software engineers to write instructions to computers.
Establishing software engineering as a discipline in 1960s which consisted of concepts, principles, theories, techniques and tools that can be used for development of high quality and reliable softwares.
The starting of structured programming in the 1970s which provided clarity in the programming of codes, making it easier to be maintained and debugged. 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements is a process where a software engineer gather and document user needs and system requirements. 
Design is a process which involves the creation of high quality and detailed software artitecture and user interface. 
Implementation is a process whereby the code is developed according to the specifications. 
Testing is a process whereby the code is tested for quality and if it's functional. 
Deployment is a process whereby the software is launched to users or customers. 
Maintenance is a process whereby the software is regulargy evaluated. 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Both the waterfall and agile methodologies follow the phases of the software development life cycle with the goal to produce high quality softwares, however, the waterfall uses linear and sequential approach whereas the agile uses iterative and incremental approach. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer develops codes and implenments software products.
Quality assurance manager is responsible for ensuring that softwares are running as per specifications using standard tests.
Project manager ensures that projects are developed and released to users as expected. The manager oversees the creation, excution and delivery of software projects. 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs assist with the writing, testing and debugging of codes. Examples includes microsoft visual studio, PyCharm, IntelliJ Idea and Eclipse. 
VCS assist software engineers to maintain and track changes to codes designed. 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing of requirements during development which can delay the project and the engineer can use the agile methodology which allows the implementation of change and communicating effectively as a team.  
Tight deadlines which could compromise the quality of the software and can be overcame by priotising important tasks.  
Technical debt which can be overcame by developing high quality softwares and reaaasessing the project goals and timelines. 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing - testing single components or modules of a software. It allows the engineers to detect bugs leading to high quality software. 
System testing - testing the software as a whole. It ensures that the software functions effectively as a whole and as per the requirements. 
Acceptance testing - testing the software against the user requirements. It ensure that the software functions as intended and aligns with consumer's requirements and market standards. 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
It is a way of crafting questions or statements to get the best response from AI models.
It is important because it determines what responses are required to achieve your goals, perform tests, uses methods that are machine friendly, prioritises your instructions, it is specific and uses examples for the AI models prompting it to give the best possible results. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example of a vague prompt: How to develop codes. Improved: How to develop codes using the waterfall or agile methodology.
It helps to improve interaction betweer the user and AI models.
